## AI Usage
In the syllabus it says itâ€™s expected of us to use AI so I used ChatGPT to teach me how to setup Jest and had it recommend npm packages to use for converting the public key to jwks format. Because I have never used a testing framework with javascript, I asked it how to set up jest in package.json, and then it gave me some settings where I then referenced back to the jest docs to verify they were right. I was having trouble setting the public key to jwks format so I asked it for npm package recommendations. It recommended some packages so I then went to their documentations and found and verified the package functions needed for converting it jwks format then implemented it myself.
